# Pac-Man Java Game (OOP Project)

A classic Pac-Man style arcade game developed in **Java** using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts and the **Java Swing/AWT graphics library**.

This project simulates the classic Pac-Man gameplay where the player controls Pac-Man to collect food, avoid ghosts, and achieve the highest possible score.

The game uses real-time rendering, collision detection, and tile-based map design to create an interactive gaming experience.
